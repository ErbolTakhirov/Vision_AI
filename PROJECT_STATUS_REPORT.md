# FINAL PROJECT REPORT & STATUS
**Project: Vision AI Assistant**
**Date: January 4, 2026**

---

### **1. Summary of Key Activities & Status**
This month, we focused on transforming the prototype into a fully functional MVP. Key activities included:
*   **Core AI Integration**: Successfully integrated YOLOv8 for real-time navigation and Faster-Whisper/Edge-TTS for a seamless voice interface.
*   **Frontend Development**: Completed the Telegram Mini App UI with full microphone and camera permission handling.
*   **Feature Implementation**: Rolled out "Hands-Free" mode with wake-word detection ("Hey Vision") and a conversational memory system (RAG Lite).
*   **Navigation**: Implemented GPS-based navigation with turn-by-turn voice guidance and AI address extraction.
*   **Testing**: Conducted initial local testing, verifying <2s latency for object detection.
*   **Smart Glasses Piviou**: Developed a complete architectural roadmap and Bill of Materials for the independent hardware wearable device ("Vision Glass").

**Current Status:** Mobile Application is Feature Complete (v1.1). We are now in stabilization phase.

### **7. Major Challenges**
1.  **Browser Autoplay Policies**: Overcame significant hurdles with mobile browser restrictions on auto-playing audio without user interaction; solved via a "Start" interaction layer.
2.  **Inference Latency**: Optimizing the YOLOv8 model to run efficiently on local hardware required detailed profiling and threading adjustments to prevent UI blocking.
3.  **Voice Interruption**: Implementing a robust "barge-in" feature where the AI stops speaking immediately when the user interrupts was complex but critical for natural dialogue.

### **8. Project Milestones Achievement**
**5 - Fully completed**
*All Phase 1 and most Phase 2 milestones were achieved as planned.*

---

### **9. Adherence to Project Timeline**
**5 - Significantly ahead of schedule**
*The core software was completed faster than anticipated, allowing us to start the hardware design phase early.*

---

### **10. Notes/Comments**
The project is ready for the next big leap: **Hardware**.
We have finalized the design for "Vision Glass" — a wearable device that removes the need for a phone. The software architecture is already compatible with this new form factor.
